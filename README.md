## Abstract

<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
  > The motivation for developing an Elderly Care Monitoring System arises from the
pressing need to ensure the safety and well-being of the aging population, especially those
living independently. Real-time health monitoring solutions can detect critical conditions
like abnormal heart rates, high temperatures, and falls, reducing health risks. Further-
more, managing multiple medications can be challenging for seniors, so incorporating a
medicine reminder feature helps ensure timely intake and prevents missed doses. This
system provides peace of mind for caregivers, enabling timely medical intervention and
better health management.<br><br>
The growing elderly population faces significant challenges in health management and
safety. Many seniors struggle to monitor vital health parameters, leading to unnoticed
risks. The complexity of medication regimens can result in missed doses, jeopardizing
their well-being. This project aims to create a comprehensive system that integrates
health monitoring, fall detection, and medication reminders, along with a fall recovery
timer to track recovery times after falls. This enhances safety, ensures timely assistance,
and improves the quality of life for elderly individuals living independently.<br> <br>
Here are the features of the Elderly Care Monitoring System:<br>
~ Real-Time Health Monitoring: Continuously tracks vital parameters such as heart
rate and body temperature, providing immediate alerts for abnormalities.<br>
~ Error-free Fall Detection Mechanism: Quickly identifies falls and notifies caregivers
at the same time avoiding any false alarms using a robust recovery timer system and
debouncing system, ensuring prompt assistance in emergencies.<br>
~ Medicine Reminder System: Alerts seniors when to take their medications, prevent-
ing missed doses and promoting adherence to medication schedules.
